## Project Description 
Crude oil is one of the worldâ€™s most important commodities. It plays a role in shaping everything from global trade and national security decisions, to impacting our everyday individual expenses. This makes crude oil sensitive to changes in the geopolitical landscape such as wars or international threats. Through this project, I aim to understand just how sensitive WTI and Brent crude oil prices are to international political conflicts and to observe those trends over time. I also hope to gain deeper understanding of the most significant geopolitical events and the repercussions from them. 

## Results and Conclusion 
My biggest findings were that there were 4 major geopolitical events since 1986 but have varying effects on oil prices. For example, the 9/11 attack was the biggest geopolitical event and had the greatest amount of news coverage at nearly 16% of all articles published that month, but oil prices were not as drastically impacted relative to other incidents such as the Russia Ukraine war. 
Additionally, I found that there is a very significant correlation between Brent and WTI oil prices despite representing two separate producing regions. 
There is also a natural grouping of oil and GPR pre and post 9/11 attacks. This can be due to a shift in media and news coverage following the attacks, entering a new period of pricing and the increase in geopolitical events in significant oil producing regions leading to a higher correlation in recent times compared to pre 9/11 times. 

## Future Work 
There can be further statistical analysis done to identify the correlation between GPR scores and oil prices.
