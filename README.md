## Project Description 
Crude oil is one of the worldâ€™s most important commodities. It plays a role in shaping everything from global trade and national security decisions, to impacting our everyday individual expenses. This makes crude oil highly sensitive to changes in the geopolitical landscape such as wars or international threats. Through this project, I aim to understand just how sensitive WTI and Brent crude oil prices are to international political conflicts and to observe those trends over time. 

## Results and Conclusion 
Project findings 

## Future Work 
There can be further statistical analysis done to identify the correlation between GPR scores and oil prices.
